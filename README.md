Course Project
=================

The only script you could find in the repo is run_analysis.R. This script transforms the Samsung data and writes new tidy dataset in
the file tidy.txt.

To run the script you should unzip archive with Samsung data into the working directory. Copy run_analysis.R into the working rirectoty and run it using command `r source("run_analysis.R")`

The transformations used to make tidy data are explained in the file *CodeBook.md*.

The project was implemented while studing on the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" by Jeff Leek, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD.
